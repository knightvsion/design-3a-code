  <h1>The birthday of the world</h1>
  <h3>BY MARGE PIERCY</h3>
  <p>On the birthday of the world</p>
  <p>I begin to contemplate</p>
  <p>what I have done and left</p>
  <p>undone, but this year</p>
  <p>not so much rebuilding</p><br>
  
  <p>of my perennially damaged</p>
  <p>psyche, shoring up eroding</p>
  <p>friendships, digging out</p>
  <p>stumps of old resentments</p>
  <p>that refuse to rot on their own.</p><br>
  
  <p>No, this year I want to call</p>
  <p>myself to task for what</p>
  <p>I have done and not done</p>
  <p>for peace. How much have</p>
  <p>I dared in opposition?</p><br>
  
  <p>How much have I put</p>
 <p>on the line for freedom?</p>
  <p>For mine and others?</p>
  <p>As these freedoms are pared,</p>
  <p>sliced and diced, where</p><br>
  
  <p>have I spoken out? Who</p>
  <p>have I tried to move? In</p>
  <p>this holy season, I stand</p>
  <p>self-convicted of sloth</p>
  <p>in a time when lies choke</p><br>
  
  <p>the mind and rhetoric</p>
  <p>bends reason to slithering</p>
  <p>choking pythons. Here</p>
  <p>I stand before the gates</p>
  <p>opening, the fire dazzling</p><br>
  
  <p>my eyes, and as I approach</p>
  <p>what judges me, I judge</p>
  <p>myself. Give me weapons</p>
  <p>of minute destruction. Let</p>
  <p>my words turn into sparks.</p>
